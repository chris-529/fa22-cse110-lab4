# 1. What is printed by line 9? If the code returns an error, explain why.

# 2. What is printed by line 13? If the code returns an error, explain why.

# 3. What is printed by line 9? If the code returns an error, explain why. 

Line 9 prints `values added: 20`

# 4. What is printed by line 13? If the code returns an error, explain why.

Line 13 returns an error because we are using `let` instead of `var` for the variable `result`, and we are trying to call it outside of it's scope. `result` can only be used inside of the `if` body

# 5. What is printed by line 9? If the code returns an error, explain why. 

Line 9 does not get printed, an error occurs due to the asignment of a `const` variable (`result`). A const variable cannot be reassigned

# 6. What is printed by line 13? If the code returns an error, explain why. 

Line 13 does not get printed either, an error occurs due to the asignment of a `const` variable (`result`). A const variable cannot be reassigned
